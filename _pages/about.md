Cryptography researcher & engineer.

Currently working with [o1Labs](https://o1labs.org/) on [Ensue/Project Untitled](https://github.com/o1-labs/ensue-whitepaper/blob/main/whitepaper.pdf) within the [Mina](https://minaprotocol.com/) ecosystem. PhD from the University of Edinburgh 2022, [BTL](https://www.ed.ac.uk/informatics/blockchain)/[LFCS](https://www.ed.ac.uk/studying/postgraduate/degrees/index.php?r=site/view&id=493), working on zero-knowledge proofs, advised by [Markulf Kohlweiss](https://scholar.google.ru/citations?user=pOfF9ygAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao). A founder of [Metajoin Ltd](https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/SC846919), an IT consultancy company specialising in cryptography focused R&D.

While in UoE I was a research consultant at [IOG](https://iohk.io/), and did a research internship at [Ethereum Foundation](https://ethereum.foundation/). Before that I finished the [MPRI](https://wikimpri.dptinfo.ens-cachan.fr/doku.php) master's programme in 2019, and my bachelor's degree is from ITMO University ([CT](https://ditp.ifmo.ru/en/) department, 2017). I was a part of the [Serokell](https://serokell.io/) team in 2015-2018 working on several blockchain-related projects including the original Cardano SL for IOHK. My area of software developer expertise then was mostly haskell ecosystem related, and I'm still a big haskell fan!

For recent activity see the [o1Labs crypto](https://o1labs.notion.site/crypto-reading-group) [seminar](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKIvwYrcKk8CjcmmYHwam_m1Yi0pw6pzB), my [blog](/blog) and [publications](/publications).
