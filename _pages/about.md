Cryptography engineer & researcher, currently working as at [O(1) Labs](https://o1labs.org/) within the [Mina](https://minaprotocol.com/) ecosystem. PhD from the University of Edinburgh 2022, [BTL](https://www.ed.ac.uk/informatics/blockchain)/[LFCS](https://www.ed.ac.uk/studying/postgraduate/degrees/index.php?r=site/view&id=493), working primarily on zero-knowledge proofs, advised by Dr. Markulf Kohlweiss. While at Edinburgh I was a research consultant at [IOG](https://iohk.io/), and did a research internship at [Ethereum Foundation](https://ethereum.foundation/).

Before that I finished the [MPRI](https://wikimpri.dptinfo.ens-cachan.fr/doku.php) master's programme in 2019, and before that got my bachelor's degree from ITMO University ([CT](https://ditp.ifmo.ru/en/) department, 2017). I was  a part of [Serokell](https://serokell.io/) team in 2015-2018 working on several blockchain-related projects including the original Cardano SL for IOHK. My area of software developer expertise then was mostly haskell ecosystem related, and I'm still a big haskell fan!

For recent activity see my [blog](/blog) and [publications](/publications).
