I am a graduating fourth year PhD student at the University of Edinburgh, [BTL](https://www.ed.ac.uk/informatics/blockchain)/[LFCS](https://www.ed.ac.uk/studying/postgraduate/degrees/index.php?r=site/view&id=493), working on zero-knowledge proofs and private smart contracts, advised by Dr. Markulf Kohlweiss. I finished the [MPRI](https://wikimpri.dptinfo.ens-cachan.fr/doku.php) master's programme in 2019, and before that got my bachelor's degree from ITMO University ([CT](https://ditp.ifmo.ru/en/) department, 2017). I have been a part of [Serokell](https://serokell.io/) team in 2015-2018 working on several blockchain-related projects, Cardano SL being one of the biggest. My area of software dev expertise then was mostly haskell ecosystem related.


Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
