I am a graduating fourth year PhD student at the University of Edinburgh, [BTL](https://www.ed.ac.uk/informatics/blockchain)/[LFCS](https://www.ed.ac.uk/studying/postgraduate/degrees/index.php?r=site/view&id=493), working on zero-knowledge proofs and private smart contracts, advised by Dr. Markulf Kohlweiss.

I finished the [MPRI](https://wikimpri.dptinfo.ens-cachan.fr/doku.php) master's programme in 2019, and before that got my bachelor's degree from ITMO University ([CT](https://ditp.ifmo.ru/en/) department, 2017). I have been a part of [Serokell](https://serokell.io/) team in 2015-2018 working on several blockchain-related projects, Cardano SL being one of the biggest. My area of software developer expertise then was mostly haskell ecosystem related.
